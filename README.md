#Banking-System

This App Is Made  As Task #1 Of My Internship In The Sparks Foundation. The App Is Basically A Basic Banking App Where The User Can Transfer Money To Other Users Having Account In The Sparks Bank.

The User Will Be Able To Know Immediately Wheather His/Her Transaction Is Successful Or Not , The User Can Also Have A Look On His Transaction History.

Every Time A User Complete His/Her Transaction Successfully He/She Will Be Updated With The Remaining Balance.
